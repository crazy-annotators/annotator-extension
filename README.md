# Web Annotation Extension

This project aims to create a browser extension according to the [Web Annotation Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/). We have been following this work for sometime now. 

We are a loosly couple group of people who are very interested in supporting web scale annotations. 

Presently we are focused on getting a trivial web extension up. Current version is for Chrome, planning to port to Firefox as soon as we get things moving along. First things first. 

In fact, we are working on two extensions. One for generating and one for consuming web annotations. But this place is dedicated to creating annotations.

The super simple extension focuses on creating text and image annotations. Hoping to have a demo by [iAnnotate Hack Day](http://iannotate.org) that will take place on  21 5 2016 in Berlin.
