# Web Annotation Extension

This project aims to create a browser extension according to the Web Annotation Data Model.

We are a loosly couple group of people who are very interested in supporting web scale annotations. 

Presently we are focused on getting a trivial web extension up. Actucally we extensions. One for generating and one for consuming web annotations.

The super simple extension focuses on creating text and image annotations. Hoping to have a demo by [[iAnnotate Hack Day][http://iannotate.org]]  on 21 5 2016
